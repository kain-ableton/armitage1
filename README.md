# Armitage Rewrite

This branch is dedicated to rewriting the armitage code in kotlin for the latest metasploit.

As a good amount of coding will be needed to replicate the armitage interface in kotlin for metasploit, it will take a good amount of my spare time. This will only be targeting the latest metasploit and backwards compatability to older versions of metasploit is unlikely. I do plan on somewhat replication the GUI and cmd in a way that it is familiar and most likely compatable with any programs made for armitage.

Note: This will follow my [Viken](https://github.com/Moocow9m/Viken) repository as the graphics library
